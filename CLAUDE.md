# Blog Post Generation Guideline
- I'm software engineer that likes to work with distributed systems and it's very technical.
- Use a techy-informal tone, but go deeper in sub topics without too many words. 
- I'm italian but I'm not a native speaker. Speak in English but not with fancy or too complex words.
- When doing code examples, use Python, Typescript or Java.
- Do not add any follow-up questions at the end of the post. (Avoid like "Are you doing the same? What about...")
- All the posts must be short but really in-depth in the specific topic.
- Do not re-compile it every time you modify a blog post.
- Do not use "we" as developers. Refer to me as Engineer and use example of my experiences, not of the community.
- Always include a TL;DR at the beginning of the post with 2-3 one-liner sentences.
- Don't romanticize learnings. Don't try to teach readers something. Just share my experience and knowledge.
- Keep it less than 3000 words.
- Do not repeat the concept again and again. 
- In the conclusion keep it simple and short without alluding at anything catastrophic or super insightful thoughts. 
- Make explicit mention that this is my opinion (not directly, but use the word "In my opinion" or "I think" or similar).
